            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Felicia, a passionate crochet artist with a love for creating timeless pieces out of wool. My crochet journey began when I was in Grade 5, when my mom first taught me how to crochet. What started as a fun skill she passed down to me quickly grew into a lifelong passion.</p>

            <p>I discovered the joy of turning a simple ball of yarn into something beautiful, whether it was my first scarf, a cozy hat, or now, the colorful ruffles, scrunchies, and tops I design today. Crocheting became more than just a craft; it became a way to express creativity, patience, and love in every stitch.</p>

            <p>Each of my handmade pieces is created with care and attention to detail, inspired by my journey and the lessons my mom taught me. I believe handmade items carry a story, and my goal is to share that warmth and creativity with everyone who wears my creations.</p>

            <p>Thank you for supporting handmade art. ðŸ’œ I would love for you to explore my collection or even request a custom design made just for you.</p>
